What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A simple directory will become a simple repository

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
it defines what we want to commit may be basically defines a changelist

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Only add files which are part of logical commit to staging area and keep rest files to working directory only. 

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

When trying new features. When multiple users are working on related /unrelated code.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
I am very happy to see these branch graph diagrams. It makes my concepts
clear also may help visualize commits which may some time gets lost if
tehre is a reachability problem.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
Result is combination of both functionality which was happened in two seperate branches. We represented merge as a commit and moved a branch label ahead to tell its a change and hence it got committed also to track 
that commit it is most suitable to setup as branch label as all other commits which are merged since last diverging will be reachabele to it.
