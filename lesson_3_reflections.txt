When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would want to use cloud to save my data so that it can be accesible
 from anywhere to me or to someone with whom i want to share this with.
  Also it may help in colaborations.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
We may working on some work in our local repository and automatic pull 
may lead to conflict or overwritting our local work. So we might not want
 to automatic pull all changes from remote.
