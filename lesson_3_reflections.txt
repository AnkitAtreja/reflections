When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would want to use cloud to save my data so that it can be accesible
 from anywhere to me or to someone with whom i want to share this with.
  Also it may help in colaborations.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
We may working on some work in our local repository and automatic pull 
may lead to conflict or overwritting our local work. So we might not want
 to automatic pull all changes from remote.

 Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

 Fork is a term in github context only and is a type of clone but from github to github.
 Clone is copying a repository from one place to another
 Branching is doing experimental work in a repository but keeping the main changes intact its like diverging the commit tree.
 I would like to add one thing that forking has hugely change the software world. Many open source
 project could come to such hieghts because of collaboration which became very easy using forking and pull request.

 What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
 we can see the logs of remote as well as compare them with our code. Also we can merge with it at time we are ready
 and that may lead to less chances of conflicts
